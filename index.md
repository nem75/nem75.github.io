### About me

My name is Jens, I am a Software Developer out of passion and been doing that
for a good 20 years.

I was born in 1975 in Bonn, Germany, where I still/again reside; I love 
well structured programming, hiking (with friends and/or family), climbing, 
sailing, reading, learning, helping people to learn, computer gaming, computer 
building and probably some other stuff I just forgot about.

Since 2016 I have been working at [Chefkoch](https://www.chefkoch.de), Europe's
biggest cooking website.
